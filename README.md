# CryptoPrices

## Description
A web application that provides price updates for the top 100 cryptocurrency coins/tokens (sorted by market cap). The user can check various data about each crypto, including market cap, trading volume, circ. supply etc. The app also provides bookmark functionality, hence lets the users save their personal favourites in a dedicated list.

Tech and tools
- JavaScript with SASS and HTML
- Coin gecko API as data source 
- MVC Architecture 

## Purpose of this creation 
I developed this App in order to get my feet into plain JS, as I mainly develop using ReactJs and found it a great idea to apply my newly gained SASS course experience . I used the MCV architecture in order to make the code readable, maintainable and more fun to write.
